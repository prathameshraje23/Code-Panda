Project : Scholarship Management

    In this project, we are providing a single platform for students in the form of website through which all students can get to know about all present government and non-government sholarships. Agencies which are providing scholarships can register themselves and can give information about scholarship. In the student section, students also have to register themselves so that sorting of students on the basis of marks, income can be possible. In this way, the website is bringining both students and agencies on single platform.
